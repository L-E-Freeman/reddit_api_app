Built with Django, this app will allow a user to search through their saved reddit posts for those originating from r/suggestmeabook and r/moviesuggestions, and pull top level comments from these threads above an upvote threshold.

As I have a large backlog of saved reddit posts from these subreddits, automation will allow me to sort through a large amount of backlogged content and provide me with top suggestions for new books to read and films to watch.
